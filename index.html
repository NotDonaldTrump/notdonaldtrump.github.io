<!DOCTYPE html>
Hello, this is my test website for the class of beyond computing, 2019. 
<em> This is my edit to the website. This may or may not take a minute or so to apply the changes.</em>
I will now create a hyperlink to my second page. <a href="./second.html">Second</a>
./second.html is referencing the local file "second.html", which we created earlier. this will create a link that displays the html code from
our second page.
